# Library Management System

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based system to manage books and users efficiently.

## Objective
To create a Java program that allows users to manage library operations such as adding books, registering users, issuing, and returning books in a structured manner.

## Features
- **Add Book** – Input book ID, title, and author to add a new book to the system.  
- **Add User** – Register a new user with a unique user ID and name.  
- **View Books** – Display all book records along with their availability status.  
- **View Users** – Display all registered users.  
- **Issue Book** – Assign a book to a user if it is available.  
- **Return Book** – Mark a previously issued book as returned.

## Implementation Details
- **Book Class** – Encapsulates book data (ID, title, author, availability).  
- **User Class** – Encapsulates user data (ID, name).  
- **Library Class** – Handles book and user management, including issue and return logic.  
- **ArrayList** – Stores all book and user objects dynamically.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface** – Provides intuitive options to perform library operations interactively.

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical example of **object-oriented programming** in Java. It demonstrates how to design and implement a structured program with core functionalities for managing library operations efficiently using classes, objects, and ArrayLists.
